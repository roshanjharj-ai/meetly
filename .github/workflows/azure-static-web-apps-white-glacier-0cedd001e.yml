          # This prevents the deployment action from including extraneous files (like node_modules) 
          # from the parent 'ui' directory, which causes the "too large" error.

          # You can remove 'output_location' as 'app_artifact_location' overrides its necessity for deployment.
          # If you must keep it (for other Oryx behaviors), ensure it's not causing file scanning issues.
